# Computer Systems & OS Internals

Systems-level coursework focused on how software interacts with the OS and hardware—useful background for troubleshooting **Linux-based** production environments.

**Tech Stack:** C/C++ • Linux/Unix • Memory Management • File Systems

### Project Highlights for Production Support:
* **OS Fundamentals:** Gained deep understanding of process scheduling, context switching, and resource allocation used in Linux environments.
* **Memory Management:** Worked directly with pointers and memory buffers, developing the logic needed to debug memory leaks and application crashes.
* **File System Operations:** Programmed low-level file I/O operations, providing the foundation for troubleshooting log files and storage issues on Virtual Machines.

## What this repository demonstrates
- Strong fundamentals in **processes**, **memory**, and **I/O**
- Practical debugging mindset (reading logs/errors, isolating root cause)
- Understanding system behavior that impacts performance and reliability

## Topics covered (typical)
- Processes/threads, scheduling concepts
- Memory management (stack/heap, virtual memory concepts)
- File systems and I/O fundamentals
- Low-level debugging and performance considerations

## Why it matters for Production Support
Many “application issues” trace back to OS-level constraints (CPU, memory, disk, permissions). This course supports that foundation.
